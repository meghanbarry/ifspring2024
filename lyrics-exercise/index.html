        I Remember Everything</h1>

    By Zach Bryan and Kasey Musgraves</h2>
    <p1><br>[Verse 1: Zach Bryan]</br>
        <br> Rotgut whiskey's gonna ease my mind</br>
        <br> Beach towel rests on the dryin' line</br>
        <br>Do I remind you of your daddy in his '88 Ford?</br>
        <br>Labrador hangin' out the passenger door</br>
        <br>The sand from your hair is blowin' in my eyes</br>
        <br>Blame it on the beach, grown men don't cry</br>
        <br>Do you remember that beat down basement couch?</br>
        <br> I'd sing you my love songs and you'd tell me about</br>
        <br>How your mama ran off and pawned her ring</br>
        <br>I remember, I remember everything</br></p1>

            <p1><br>[Chorus: Zach Bryan]</br>
            <br>A cold shoulder at closing time</br>
            <br>You were bеggin' me to stay 'til the sun rose</br>
            <br>Strangе words come on out</br>
            <br>Of a grown man's mouth when his mind's broke</br>
            <br>Pictures and passin' time</br>
            <br>You only smile like that when you're drinkin'</br>
            <br>I wish I didn't, but I do</br>
            <br>Remember every moment on the nights with you</br></p1>

                    <br>[Verse 2: Kacey Musgraves]</br>
                    <br>You're drinkin' everything to ease your mind</br>
                    <br>But when the hell are you gonna ease mine?</br>
                    <br>You're like concrete feet in the summer heat</br>
                    <br>It burns like hell when two souls meet</br>
                    <br>No, you'll never be the man that you always swore</br>
                    <br>But I'll remember you singin' in that '88 Ford</br>
