        <h1>Introductory Questions</h1>
<ol>
    <li><b>Provide your name, major, year in school (sophomore, junior, etc).</b></li>
    <p>My name is Meghan Barry. My primary major is Communication Design and I have a second major in Marketing. I am a current senior.</p>
    <li><b>Tell us a bit about your background and what prompted you to take this class.</b></li>
    <p>My background is primarily in design using Adobe Suite. I have some experience using Figma, but past that nothing in the coding world. Honestly, I am taking this class because it is a major requirement.</p>
    <li><b>Do you have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS? If so, tell us a bit about it.</b></li>
    <p>I have no experience at all with any of these.</p>
    <li><b>Name one thing you hope to learn in this class.</b></li>
    <p>I hope to build a solid foundation for coding in this class. My goal is to walk away confident that I can apply my design skills to actually create a functioning web page.</p>
    <li><b>Name one way you expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper.</b></li>
    <p>One way I expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper is that on screen you have to account for different orientations. On paper, everyone will look at the same size. However, web pages can be viewed on a variety of different size screens, and a successful design should adapt to all of them.</p>
    <li><b>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective design. Explain your choice.</b></li>
   <p> <a href="https://eyeondesign.aiga.org/">AIGA Eye on Design</a>
    <br>A website that I think exemplifies effective design is AIGA Eye on Design. What makes this website successful in my eyes is the use of microinteractions. From the loading screen is their eye logo, every image you hover over having a coral translucent overlay and text fidgeting when hovered over, the microinteractions really help catch the viewer's eye and prompt them to engage with the webpage. Additionally, I think having a small color scheme works well for a website that features many images from their articles.</br></p>
    
    <li><b>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective communication. Explain your choice.</b></li>
    <p> <a href="https://www.hellofresh.com/">HelloFresh</a>
        <br>I think HelloFresh exemplifies effective communication because of the clear prompts. The home page provides many options a customer may look for, such as looking at the menu or pricing. If someone who visits the website is ready to buy, right on the homepage they are able to click a button to start walking them through the process with a discounted rate. When looking at this website, there are no questions about where you are supposed to go next, and I find it very hard to get lost on this page.</br></p>
    <li><b>Provide a link to a website you think works well. Explain your choice.</b></li>
    <p> <a href="https://www.glossier.com/">Glossier</a>
        <br>I think the Glossier website works well for a variety of reasons. For one, their clean and minimalist aesthetic is clearly displayed through the muted colors and natural skin photos. Secondly, I find the website very easy to navigate. On the homepage, there are clear directions to click to depending on what someone wants to shop for. Lastly, a nice touch that I rarely see on brand websites is an index of sorts at the bottom, in which you can navigate directly to a specific product without searching.</br></p>
